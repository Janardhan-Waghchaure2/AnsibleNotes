Control Node: This is the machine from which you run Ansible commands. It's the central point 
where you execute playbooks and manage configurations. The control node can be any computer that 
meets the software requirements, such as a laptop, desktop, or server.

Managed Node: These are the target devices that Ansible manages. Managed nodes can be servers, 
network appliances, virtual machines, or any other devices you want to automate. Typically, Ansible is 
not installed on managed nodes, but it connects to them to apply configurations and run tasks.
