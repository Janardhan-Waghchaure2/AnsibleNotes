In computing, services and processes are related but distinct concepts:

Process: A process is an instance of a running program. It includes the 
         program code and its current activity. Processes can be user-initiated 
         (like opening a web browser) or system-level (like background tasks). 
         Each process has its own memory space and system resources.

Service: A service is a specialized type of process that runs in the background 
         and performs specific functions, often without direct user interaction. 
         Services are typically used to provide system-level functions like networking, 
         printing, or system updates. 
         They start automatically at boot time and run continuously.

In summary, while all services are processes, not all processes are services.
 
Services are designed to run in the background and provide ongoing functionality, 
whereas processes can be any running program or task.
