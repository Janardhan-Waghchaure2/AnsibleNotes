1. imagine a scenario where we have a lots of variables and tasks in a file
   so instead of writing all of them into a single file with tasks we can
   just create a seperate file for them.

--- variable.yml
var1: var1
var2: var2
.
.
var4: var4

--- tasks.yml
-
  name: 'task1'
  command: touch /tmp/var/{{ var1}}.txt
-
  name: 'task2'
  command: touch /tmp/var/{{ var2}}.txt
-
  name: 'task3'
  command: touch /tmp/var/{{ var3}}.txt
-
  name: 'task4'
  command: touch /tmp/var/{{ var4}}.txt


--- playbook.yml

-
 name: this is our first play.
 hosts: webserver1
 vars_files:
    - variable.yml
 tasks:
    - include: task.yml



-------------------
2. we can also add multiple variable files under vars_files
