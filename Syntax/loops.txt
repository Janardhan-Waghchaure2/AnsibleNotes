let's say we want to install 2 packages as shown below  
---
-
  name: installing packages without loop 
  hosts: webserver1
  tasks:
      -
       name: "installing"
       apt: 
	name:"vsftpd" 
	state:present
      -
       name: "installing"
       apt:
	 name:"tree" 
         state:present

# in above code there is a lot of code duplication and if we want to install more
# packages then there will be 3 lines needed per package installed. so instead use
# below looping syntax.

  name: looping demonstration play
  hosts: webserver1
  tasks:
       -
        name: "installing"
        apt: name="{{ item }}" state=persent
        with_items:
              - vsftpd
              - tree
