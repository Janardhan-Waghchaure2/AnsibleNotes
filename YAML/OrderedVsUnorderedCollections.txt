In YAML, collections can be either ordered or unordered, and they are represented 
using different structures:


Ordered Collections

	1.Sequences: These are ordered lists of items, similar to arrays in other programming languages. 
		     Each item in a sequence is denoted by a dash (-).
		     For example:
			fruits:
  			  - apple
  			  - banana
  			  - cherry

	2.Ordered Mappings: YAML supports ordered mappings using the !!omap tag, 
          which ensures that the order of key-value pairs is preserved. For example:
		       !!omap
			 - Mark McGwire: 65
			 - Sammy Sosa: 63
			 - Ken Griffey: 58

Unordered Collections

	1. Mappings: These are key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries or hash maps. 
           The order of keys is not guaranteed. For example:
	   player_stats:
  		hr: 65
  		avg: 0.278
  		rbi: 147

	2. Sets: YAML represents sets as mappings where each key is associated with a null value. 
	   For example:
		set1: !!set
  		      ? one
  		      ? two
