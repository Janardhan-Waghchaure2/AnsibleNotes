In the world of Ansible, adhoc commands and playbooks serve different 
purposes, each with its own advantages.

Adhoc Commands

Purpose: Used for quick, one-time tasks.

Usage: You run these commands directly from the command line.

Syntax: They are straightforward and donâ€™t require any files.


Advantages:

Quick and easy to use for immediate tasks.

No need to write files or scripts.
---------------------

Playbooks

Purpose: Used for more complex, repeatable tasks.

Usage: Playbooks are YAML files that define the desired state of the system.

Syntax: They are written in YAML and can include tasks, variables, and roles.


Advantages:

Reusable and can be version controlled.

Supports complex workflows and dependencies.

Can be parameterized and modular using roles and variables.


----------------------

In summary, if you need to execute a quick command across your hosts, 
adhoc commands are the way to go. However, for more detailed and 
repeatable automation, playbooks are the better choice.
